HuffmanEncoding.m   ->  Project begins.  
HufmannTree.m       ->  Generates Huffman Tree.  
HuffmanCode.m       ->  Generates Huffman Code.  
sorted_Code.m       ->  Sorts Huffman Codes in increasing order of their frequencies.  
isLeaf.m            ->  Tells if the node of the tree is leaf or not.  
Decode.m            ->  Decodes the Encoded file.  
  
The files with filename "File#.txt" are the input files.  
The files with filename "Code#.txt" are the Huffman Code files for the corresponding Input files.  
The files with filename "Encoded#.txt" are the Huffman Encoded files of the corresponding Input files.  
The files with filename "Decoded#.txt" are the Decoded files of the corresponding Encoded files.  
  
Time Complexity for finding the Huffman Tree + Huffman Codes from the input is O(N.logN) where 'N' is the no. of distinct charecters in input.
